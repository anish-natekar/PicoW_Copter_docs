Welcome to PicoW_Copter_Docs's documentation!
=============================================
This is the Official Documentation for the PicoW Copter
The PicoW Copter is an open source micro sub 60g quadcopter that is controlled using WiFi via a smartphone or computer.
The PicoW Copter is designed to be a low cost, easy to build, and fun to fly quadcopter.

Hardware
========

The Hardware required can be found in the Hardware folder of PicoW Copter project.
The Harware folders contains a BOM, PCB gerber files, and STL file for the frame.
The BOM provided contains links for the parts from online indian websites but you can easily find them for other countries as well.
